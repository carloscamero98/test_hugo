The rise of software providers over the last 20 years created an ecosystem where one-size-fits-all software solutions were the standard. And for a while, these blanket solutions made a huge impact on tech-newbie industries. But today, customers’ expectations for software solutions are much more tailored, putting the responsibility on providers to move fast or die slow.  According to a McKinsey & Company examination on how user experience expectations has outpaced the industry’s innovation, vendors “need to match the streamlined, customer-friendly as-a-service product-delivery experience with a similarly streamlined and customer-friendly end-to-end journey.”

With a gap between slow-moving software providers and customer needs, Jason Riffel and Dan Roy – the eventual founders of CIP Reporting – witnessed firsthand how detrimental this could be to businesses. Working in facial recognition technology at a casino, Riffel and Roy were disappointed with the software the casino used for risk management. It was clunky, workflow-poor, and wasn’t designed with risk management processes in mind. With an array of high-value assets and complex operations, effective risk management is critical to safety, compliance, and profitability. Yet a casino’s software options at the time were viewed as “better than nothing” tools, instead of “perfect for us” solutions. Ever the problem solvers, Riffel and Roy put their longtime engineering skills to the task, and in 2006, CIP Reporting was born.

With software as intuitive and responsive as CIP Reporting, it is easy to forget that there are humans behind the scenes, tinkering away to consistently make improvements and enhance certain features.when people work in software development for hours,getting neck pain is usual . There are many ways to get rid of neck pain as part of your health development by consulting nearest chiropractor .But Jason Riffel, founder, COO, and CTO of CIP Reporting, has been creating, fine tuning, and problem-solving in the software world since the age of 8. In the of the latest episode of the CIP Reporting’s Podcast, Riffel shares the origin story of CIP Reporting and how embracing customization in software is essential to a business’ approach to risk management. As an engineer, it’s the opportunity to listen to a customer’s needs and craft a tailored solution that still excites Riffel the most.

“At my core, I am an engineer. And our entire CIP Reporting team is a group of engineers who are constantly challenged and excited by understanding problems and how to solve them. It’s an art form, and most people don’t understand how artistic it really is, but engineers are some of the most creative people you’ll ever meet. And they like to understand a problem, identify it, and come up with creative and elegant solutions for it,” says Riffel.

This tailored approach to software is slowly becoming the norm, but for CIP Reporting, creating industry-specific and company-specific solutions has been the priority from day one. As Riffel puts it, what CIP Reporting provides is “both the software that operates your risk platform and the team that has the ability to listen, understand, break down the problems and challenges, and turn them into a creative solution that makes your operation work correctly.”

 CIP Reporting quickly became the go-to for casinos, but the company has penetrated other risk-laden industries, meanwhile expanding its services to encompass compliance, healthcare (that you can see it here) and workplace safety, incident reporting, and background investigations and licensing. By marrying documentation-centric software, custom applications, robust workflows, and a powerful analytic platform, CIP Reporting clients end up with a nearly custom designed software solution that’s specifically built for their organizational chart, their workflow, and their risk portfolio.

Industries need risk management to be as efficient and focused as possible, as the target for exposure is constantly changing.

“The biggest challenge with risk management and what companies face is there is pressure to grow and change, stay relevant, and be effective in whatever business practice they’re in. That growth and change constantly changes their risk portfolio,” shares Riffel.

Of course, it’s not just the risk portfolio that companies are concerned with. Risk management is just an ingredient to a company’s overall health. CIP Reporting’s solutions are designed to help company staff at all levels meet risk management standards, which fosters increased visibility and creates a culture of reporting that all businesses can benefit from.

“I think that most companies struggle to create a culture of reporting because reporting something is generally seen as a bad thing. Employees don’t generally want to report things. One of the biggest things that we try to instill in new customers is to capture both good and bad incidents, because it balances that out. It makes people feel more comfortable. You start to develop a true culture of reporting within the organization and break those stigmas of reporting actionable data. Which then increases the visibility into what’s going on within your workplace so you can make those changes and lower risk,” says Riffel.

Riffel shares how increased visibility and a solid culture of reporting has helped CIP Reporting client, Chickasaw Nation, the thirteenth largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. Supporting the Chickasaw Nation through every aspect of their risk management needs, including coordination with government and court systems, emergency management response, incident management, protective services, security dispatching and more, CIP Reporting helped them grow and revolutionize what they provide to their nation of 38,000.

Regardless of the industry, CIP Reporting’s dedication to tailoring solutions with an organization’s existing infrastructure will continue to help them as they navigate future trends and their implications on risk management. Riffel shares that companies will be between a rock and a hard place to promote visibility in the workplace as issues of privacy and personal data become more prevalent.

“We will see a tremendous amount of evolution on how we increase visibility while also protecting people’s information. Both our platform, and the industry at large, will have to make great strides over the next few years to really continue to increase visibility while understanding those regulatory requirements.

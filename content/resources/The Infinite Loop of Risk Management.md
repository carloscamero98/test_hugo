Companies are constantly evolving. They’re, developing new tools, technologies, methods, and processes to continue to improve and grow. However, these advancements often also introduce new and varying risks that we must be prepared to navigate and minimize.

Managing these risks is not easy. Rather than a straight-line workflow, risk management is about an iterating loop of constant analysis, trial, and error. In turn, our risk management processes need to be flexible, adaptable, continuous, and all-encompassing.

To ensure our safety focus doesn’t get consumed or distracted by the newest trend or tool, we must never forget to maintain our processes, stay with the basics, and keep it low-risk. We must remain centered around the essentials of risk management.

No matter the business—its size or industry—workplace safety is among the top issues that can derail a company’s prosperity and growth. In addition to managing day-to-day operations, businesses must uphold the regulations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), from industry standards to active reporting.
With more than [5,000 workers](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cftb0331.htm) dead as a result of a workplace incident in 2019, and an estimated [$1 billion](https://www.osha.gov/businesscase) in workers compensation paid each week by employers and insurance companies, companies must invest time and attention into maintaining OSHA standards and avoid issues that put employees, customers, reputation, and revenue in peril. While the level of injury, illness, or fatality risks in workplaces cannot be completely mitigated, businesses have tools and tips to uphold safety and master OSHA compliance.

Not incorporated within these incidents is the workplace risks created by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the COVID-19 virus has not been classified as an OSHA-covered hazard, workplaces have to be diligent in their efforts to maintain safety with social distancing and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Employees need easy-to-access resources to recognize and refresh risk management standards in their field. Create a centralized location with tangible OSHA guidelines and steps to prevention to ensure active learning and education are working towards a safer work environment for employees and customers alike.

**Financial burden:** 

 OSHA fines for non-compliance and workplace incidents can run anywhere from [$13,000 to $130,000](https://www.osha.gov/penalties). Repeat and willful penalties are enough to put serious financial constraints on any business and doesn’t include the legal costs that often come with employee incidents. Workers’ compensation settlements average $21,800 and can cause insurance premiums to soar. 

**Employee and customer safety:** 

 When OSHA standards are weakened or disregarded within workplaces, employees and customers can be exposed to serious hazards, injuries, and illnesses. Even among reasonable or unavoidable workplace accidents, the fallout can potentially thwart future employee and customer satisfaction. 

**Damaged reputation:**  

Litigation, press coverage, and whistleblowing can quickly make an OSHA violation into a public relations disaster. Lost revenue and diminished customer buy-in often outweigh the direct, financial responsibilities of OSHA violations.

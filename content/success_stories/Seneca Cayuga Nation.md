        title: 'Next Step: Implementing the Background Check and Licensing Module'
        content: This spring, the Seneca–Cayuga Gaming Commission will roll out the final module within CIP Reporting’s Gaming Suite, the background check and licensing module. “We are looking forward to bringing the licensing module live. I expect it will drive superior efficiency within the licensing team and it will help tremendously with our Title 31 efforts,” says Brashear.

    benefit1:
        title: "Ability to Work as One Cohesive Team"
        points: 
        - Now using built-in workflows and permission-based data access, the right people are informed of the workings of the agency and casino. For instance, violations logged by the surveillance department against an employee will be shared with licensing for consideration upon renewing the employee’s license.
    benefit2:
        title: "Ability to Uncover Opportunities for Improvement"
        points: 
        - Using CIP Reporting’s analytics, for example, the commission identified that more than 50% of all findings had been related to cash handling and responded by implementing appropriate corrective measures. The commission also found that the machines from one gaming vendor were significantly less reliable than others, leading them to switch these for higher-performing machines.
    benefit3:
        title: "Financial Savings"
        points: 
        - Previously, all forms had to be printed, filled out, and mailed or faxed. Now that these are managed electronically, these hard costs have been eliminated.
    benefit4:
        title: "Saved Employee Time"
        points: 
        - Mobile access and built-in checklists, workflows, and reports have lessened clerical duties. CIP Reporting ensures all data is being collected at the point of discovery, is shared and escalated as designated by the defined workflows, and can be reported on automatically.
    benefit5:
        title: "Complete Visibility Into all Work"
        points: 
        - Automatically generated reports, analytics, and the ability to search on any field provide the real-time visibility into every aspect of the business, present or past, in a format that is shareable with others.
    benefit4:
        title: "Easy to Update"
        points: 
        - It is simple for the commission to manage regulation and process changes such as those of the System of Internal Controls (SICS) with CIP Reporting’s centralized structure.
    benefit4:
        title: "Improved Non-Compliance Tracking and Enforcement Abilities"
        points: 
        - With greater insights into casino operations, the commission has been able to take enforcement actions to cure ongoing non-compliance issues that were previously too hard to identify and track.

        The goal of Seneca–Cayuga’s Gaming Commission Agency is quite specific: ensure the integrity of the games and protect the interest of the tribe through comprehensive regulation. While the agency’s team of 25—spanning compliance, auditing, surveillance, and licensing—was working hard, it was struggling to deliver the desired results.

        “My team was lacking insight into one another’s work. There was duplication of work efforts, and it was difficult to share information among the team quickly enough to make an impact. Our ability to report and track performance was near impossible as was our ability to report our work to leadership and regulatory bodies. These challenges led to a list of non-compliance exceptions,” says Danielle Brashear, Seneca–Cayuga’s Gaming Commissioner.”

    Brashear had a clear vision for the future of her team. She wanted one system for the entire team, where all permissible information would be shared. She wanted to break down departmental barriers and increase the effectiveness and collaboration of the group. She wanted a system that would offer complete, real-time visibility into the efforts and progress of the team as well as robust reporting and analytics that would enable the team to prove compliance to regulatory bodies, demonstrate work effort to leadership, and provide insights to support ongoing efficiency gains.

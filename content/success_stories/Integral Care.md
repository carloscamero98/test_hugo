        Spanning 45 locations, Integral Care’s 900 employees serve nearly 30,000 adults and children living with mental illness, substance use disorder, and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities. For Melody Moscal, Integral Care’s Quality Experience Administrator, keeping clients and staff safe is the top priority. She depends on timely, complete, and trackable incident reporting to stay informed on trends in order implement necessary risk-minimizing practices.

        The previous incident reporting tool Moscal and her team had been using, however, was hindering the team’s efforts. They were inundated with support calls and data management issues as their staff of 900 occasionally forgot their tool-specific password, lost and then duplicated reports due to the tool timing out without saving the in-progress report, and struggled with the tool’s confusing user interface. Plus, Moscal and her team lacked the ability to review the incidents, gain insight into pertinent activity, or track the required next steps.

        content: “The CIP Reporting sales team was highly attentive and responsive, but never pushy. When asking about a feature they didn’t have, the response was not ‘yes’ or ‘no’ but rather ‘we can work with you on that.’ The thing that blew me away, though, is the deep level of mutual loyalty between CIP Reporting and its customers—it’s unlike anything I have ever witnessed before.” shares Schuetz.

        L.A. Live has evolved into Los Angeles’ premier entertainment destination, annually hosting more than 1,500 events, including sports, concerts, festivals, film premieres, and award shows. It is also home to renowned restaurants, a massive Regal movie theater, multiple prestigious hotels, conference space, and more. So it’s not surprising that ensuring the security and safety of its more than 20 million annual guests is a top concern.

        Schuetz needed a security solution that would enable expedited call logging, provide an efficient system for dispatching the appropriate security response when incidents arise, and feature a more effective way to generate reports and analyze patterns and trends in support of data-driven decisions.

    Several years ago, Joe Schuetz, Security Director at L.A. Live, decided it was time to re-evaluate the software his security team used to respond to and manage incidents. “The software we had been using enabled us to log an incident, but it was highly labor intensive, its dispatch functionality was weak, and it was nearly impossible to query or derive any kind of analytics,” says Schuetz. “The other products we found dealt only with singular events, which wouldn’t work either as our operations go around the clock and cannot be bound by calendar or clock-based limitations. I knew there had to be a better solution.”

L.A. Live selected CIP Reporting’s Incident Reporting solution to increase operational efficiency and effectiveness within the security department. “CIP Reporting met all of my requirements, but its configurability, built-in notifications and escalations, analytics, and overall customer service made CIP Reporting stand out,” says Schuetz.

With CIP Reporting, L.A. Live’s security team is now empowered to make continuous improvements in streamlining its operations by ensuring it is adding resources and assets appropriately, while remaining within the allocated budget.
“I was shocked to find, for example, that 61% of the calls my dispatch team was receiving are related to our homeless population—that’s much more than I would have thought. These CIP Reporting-generated analytics enable me to make data-informed changes to ensure we’re continuously operating most effectively,” says Schuetz.

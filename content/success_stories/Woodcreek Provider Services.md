        content: “The CIP Reporting sales team was highly attentive and responsive, but never pushy. When asking about a feature they didn’t have, the response was not ‘yes’ or ‘no’ but rather ‘we can work with you on that.’ The thing that blew me away, though, is the deep level of mutual loyalty between CIP Reporting and its customers—it’s unlike anything I have ever witnessed before.” shares Schuetz.

    benefit1:
        title: "Improved Patient Experience"
        points: 
        - When a patient reaches out with a concern, the quality improvement team immediately searches CIP Reporting for the patient history and for any similar issues to ensure consistent issue handling.

    benefit3:
        title: "Supports Change Management"
        points: 
        - CIP Reporting is configurable to support evolving needs and requirements. Equally important, though, CIP Reporting provides the data to support change. “Staff would ask me, ‘Why are we doing it this way?’ Now I have the data to show them why,” explains Miller
    benefit4:
        title: "Build a Culture of Reporting and Increased Staff Engagement"
        points: 
        - CIP Reporting’s easy-to-use interface along with its Kudos reporting have been the catalyst in getting staff to use the system more frequently

    benefit5:
        title: "Increased Efficiency and Time Savings"
        points: 
        - All reports are managed centrally and workflow is built into the system. “If there’s an issue that needs legal consultation, all I have to do is click a button to pull a report for our legal team to review; if I have an incident that needs input from someone else, I can assign it within CIP Reporting to that person and they will be prompted to take the next steps—regardless of their geographical location. CIP Reporting saves my team tremendous, precious time,” says Miller

    benefit6:
        title: "Increased Compliance"
        points: 
        - The simple, Woodcreek-specific interface removes the roadblocks associated with more cumbersome HIPAA and OSHA reporting processes. Plus, given CIP Reporting is a secure environment, Woodcreek can ensure HIPAA compliance while communicating with one another to resolve patient-related issues

“It all starts with safety” is Woodcreek Provider Services’ employee safety mantra. Woodcreek leaders maintain a keen focus on providing the best quality of care and doing so safely—and they continuously search for ways to improve.

Just a few years back, Woodcreek was using pen and paper to manage all quality-of-care and staff issues. When there was an incident, employees would print a copy of the necessary form, handwrite all pertinent information, and turn it in to the appropriate manager. The manager then wrote down the resolution and filed the form away. Meanwhile, nursing issues were managed separately using a spreadsheet that was stored on a shared drive.

“Our paper and pencil method wasn’t meeting our high standards,” says Melissa Miller, Quality Improvement Manager at Woodcreek Provider Services. “We needed an electronic way to centrally track all issues that might be limiting our ability to deliver appropriate care, and a means to understand the trends so we could determine and implement the appropriate corrective actions. It was critical we find something more effective, less cumbersome, and that offered greater insights.”

“In these past few years, due to our growth as an organization, our success building a culture of reporting, as well as changes in state immunization reporting, my team has gone from managing roughly 30 reports to more than 300 reports each month. With CIP Reporting, my team is not only able to manage this increase in volume, but we have great confidence that each issue is being handled appropriately and any gaps are being closed. With CIP Reporting, we are positioned to ensure our patients get the best possible care,” states Miller.

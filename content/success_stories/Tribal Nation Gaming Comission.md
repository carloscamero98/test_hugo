        content: “The CIP Reporting sales team was highly attentive and responsive, but never pushy. When asking about a feature they didn’t have, the response was not ‘yes’ or ‘no’ but rather ‘we can work with you on that.’ The thing that blew me away, though, is the deep level of mutual loyalty between CIP Reporting and its customers—it’s unlike anything I have ever witnessed before.” shares Schuetz.

{{< section_sub_title white center none background_light_blue  >}} Transforming Background Investigations and Licensing to Increase Compliance and Enhance Efficiency

        The Background and Licensing (B&L) Department works diligently to protect the Tribal Nation’s gaming operations by ensuring all applicants meet the requirements to hold a privileged gaming license or permit. Just a few years back though, the department hit a tipping point. Its paper-based system for processing applications was inefficient, was not trackable, and incurred significant expense.
        {{< /container >}}
        {{< container >}}
        At the time, this tribal nation’s four B&L offices were processing 8,000-10,000 applications each year in support of its 24 gaming facilities. Each application type—license or permit; employee, vendor, or vendor representative; new or renewal—prompted specific procedures that were documented, processed, and managed via a combination of paper, mail, fax, and email. The B&L team was drowning in piles of paper, applications often took more than a month to process, and compliance issues arose as it was difficult to meet specified timelines.

    {{< container accent_orange  >}}
        While the B&L team was working as hard as possible to ensure only those approved were able to enter their casinos, they recognized the need for increased speed as every day an employee isn’t licensed or a vendor doesn’t have a permit is a day of work lost. It was critical they find and implement a solution to optimize their processes and maximize their efforts.

{{< section_sub_title white center none background_light_blue  >}} From a Paper-Based, Inefficient Process to an Integrated B&L Solution
 {{< /section_sub_title>}}

After thorough evaluation, this Office of the Gaming Commissioner’s B&L team selected CIP Reporting to automate their background investigation and licensing work. CIP Reporting was the only solution found that offered the depth, flexibility, and configurability required to support their processes.

The B&L team rolled out CIP Reporting in phases, taking a total of four months to be fully operational across all application types. With CIP Reporting, the B&L team gained:

“The greatest proof of success is that we are now consistently 100% compliant with all regulatory bodies,” shares this Gaming Commission’s B&L Manager. “While we were always technically compliant, we faltered meeting timelines as we just couldn’t get the work done fast enough. With CIP Reporting, that’s no longer an issue."

In addition to 100% compliance, the B&L team outlines additional benefits they have gained using CIP Reporting:

The next immediate goal is to integrate pertinent B&L data with that of the Surveillance Department, which will also be powered by CIP Reporting. This bi-directional, permission-based data share will enable both teams to work more efficiently. With this integration, Surveillance will have complete, real-time information regarding who is and is not licensed, and B&L will have visibility into any surveillance incidents logged related to an employee or vendor, information that will be critical in determining a license renewal.

“We have tested CIP Reporting and pushed its boundaries, but we haven’t found its limit—and I don’t know that there is one,” concludes the Gaming Commission’s B&L Manager.

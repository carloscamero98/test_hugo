      <description>You’ve heard the saying, “the sky is the limit.” This saying is tailor-made to what I want to talk about today. When prospective clients ask about our risk management software, I always point out that CIP Reporting will bend around your existing processes rather than make you conform to some process dreamed up by someone not even in their business.
I also stress that CIP Reporting can integrate with just about any external system, such as badging systems, HR databases, and so many more.</description>

      <description>It’s clear the COVID-19 pandemic changed every aspect of our lives. We’ve changed how we live, how we work, and we’ve even changed what we wear. But for a business leader, the pandemic has fundamentally shifted how we operate our business — at least it should have. While some companies may have adapted their day-to-day operations during the pandemic, there are greater lessons to be considered in how we approach technology and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Advantages of SaaS Over On-Premises Deployments</title>

      <description>As data security and privacy standards attract increased scrutiny—both from customers and regulators—organizations may find themselves leaning towards on-premises software hosting in an attempt to maintain ultimate control. It’s a natural reaction as there are still skeptics about the safety of outside, cloud-based software. But where on-premises software may seem like the sure thing, SaaS (Software as a Service) is continuously proven to be more nimble, scalable, cost-efficient—AND secure.
For industries with highly sensitive security needs, SaaS has become a trusted solution thanks to its ability to exceed compliance requirements.</description>

      <description>We can all identify with the collective “phew” we feel when we know we’ve narrowly avoided a mishap, no matter how minor. For businesses, especially ones with high-risk environments, a close call is much more than a reminder to knock on wood. For hospitals, factories, event spaces, and more, just the possibility of an incident occurring is enough to influence operations. Often referred to as “near miss” events, companies can learn a lot about their exposure to risk from these close calls.</description>

      <title>CIP Reporting’s Story: The Origin</title>

      <description>The rise of software providers over the last 20 years created an ecosystem where one-size-fits-all software solutions were the standard. And for a while, these blanket solutions made a huge impact on tech-newbie industries. But today, customers’ expectations for software solutions are much more tailored, putting the responsibility on providers to move fast or die slow. According to a McKinsey &amp;amp; Company examination on how user experience expectations has outpaced the industry’s innovation, vendors “need to match the streamlined, customer-friendly as-a-service product-delivery experience with a similarly streamlined and customer-friendly end-to-end journey.</description>

      <title>What You Need to Know: Upholding Workplace Safety and Maintaining OSHA Compliance</title>
      <link>http://example.org/resources/upholding-workplace-safety-and-maintaining-osha-compliance/</link>

      <description>No matter the business—its size or industry—workplace safety is among the top issues that can derail a company’s prosperity and growth. In addition to managing day-to-day operations, businesses must uphold the regulations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), from industry standards to active reporting. With more than 5,000 workers dead as a result of a workplace incident in 2019, and an estimated $1 billion in workers compensation paid each week by employers and insurance companies, companies must invest time and attention into maintaining OSHA standards and avoid issues that put employees, customers, reputation, and revenue in peril.</description>

      <description>With the turbulence of our world today, managing and minimizing risk has never been more important. The pressure to ensure the right protocols are followed—by everyone, all the time, regardless of scenario—is tremendous. Corporate reputations are at risk, the safety of people and assets is vulnerable, and customers are increasingly intolerant of any corporate misstep.
It’s for reasons like these that risk management departments are an increasingly critical part of many organizational structures today.</description>

      <description>The Continuous Risk Management Process Companies are constantly evolving. They’re, developing new tools, technologies, methods, and processes to continue to improve and grow. However, these advancements often also introduce new and varying risks that we must be prepared to navigate and minimize.
Managing these risks is not easy. Rather than a straight-line workflow, risk management is about an iterating loop of constant analysis, trial, and error. In turn, our risk management processes need to be flexible, adaptable, continuous, and all-encompassing.</description>

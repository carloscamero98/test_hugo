It is therefore critical to have a robust system for reporting, documenting, and tracking near misses, incidents, and claims wherever they occur in the world.</description>

      <description>Transforming Background Investigations and Licensing to Increase Compliance and Enhance EfficiencyThe Background and Licensing (B&amp;L) Department works diligently to protect the Tribal Nation’s gaming operations by ensuring all applicants meet the requirements to hold a privileged gaming license or permit. Just a few years back though, the department hit a tipping point. Its paper-based system for processing applications was inefficient, was not trackable, and incurred significant expense.At the time, this tribal nation’s four B&amp;L offices were processing 8,000-10,000 applications each year in support of its 24 gaming facilities.</description>
